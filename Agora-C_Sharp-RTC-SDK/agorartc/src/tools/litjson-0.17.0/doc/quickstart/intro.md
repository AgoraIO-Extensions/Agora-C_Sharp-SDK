# Introduction

JSON is a simple, yet powerful notation to specify data. It defines simple
scalar types such as *boolean*, *number* (integers and reals) and *string*,
and a couple of data structures: arrays (lists) and objects (dictionaries).
For more information on the JSON format, visit
[JSON.org](http://www.json.org/).

LitJSON is written in C#, and it's intended to be small, fast and easy to
use. It was developed on a GNU/Linux environment, using the
[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) framework.
