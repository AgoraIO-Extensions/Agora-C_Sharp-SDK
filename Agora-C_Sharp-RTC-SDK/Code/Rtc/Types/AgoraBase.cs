It is not recommended for common audio and video interactive scenarios (for example, voice chat, cohosting, or online KTV).When this parameter is enabled, Agora recommends that you set a regular period (such as 30 ms), and then call the UpdatePlayerPositionInfo , UpdateSelfPosition , and UpdateRemotePosition methods to continuously update the relative distance between the sound source and the receiver. The following factors can cause the Doppler effect to be unpredictable or the sound to be jittery: the period of updating the distance is too long, the updating period is irregular, or the distance information is lost due to network packet loss or delay.
