### Create an Account and Obtain an App ID

To use our SDK, you must obtain an app ID: 

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the sign-up process, you are redirected to the dashboard.
2. Navigate in the dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Copy the app ID that you obtained from the dashboard into a text file. You will use it when you run demo (there is an input box in our GUI demo).
